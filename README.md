## SUMMARY
This project analyzes event, attendance, and volunteer data from Knights of Columbus Council 16207 to identify which activities generate the highest engagement and which fundraising opportunities the council should prioritize. Using this analysis, I developed a data‑driven framework for setting goals, defining KPIs, and improving continuity in a high‑turnover college organization.

### Project Demonstrations
1. Data cleaning and transformation
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. KPI development
4. Insight‑driven recommendations
5. Real‑world operational impact
6. Leadership and systems thinking

### Why it Matters
Previous Colombian years showed that our council has a high drive for volunteering, but with low measurable impact. This project shows what avenues our council should target based on other organizational volunteering efforts and our own projects. This effort also serves as a sustainable system for future members to employ themselves.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
**Council 16207 has no consistent fundraising strategy or performance metrics, limiting its ability to support charitable initiatives despite strong member engagement and volunteer hours.**

---

## STRATEGY
### What is our mission?
This can be answered with the following three questions:
1. What are we passionate about? **Serving those less fortunate**
    - Homeless ministry
    - Serving our Newman Parish community (coffee+donutes, helping with events)
    - 
2. What are we good at? ****
    - Moving 
3. Why do we perservere? **To protect life at all stages**
    - Since the founding of KofC in 1882, we have served as the social safety net of society
    - Life insurance
    - Morale for soldiers during waretime
    - Ultrasound inititive
    - Education for war veterans
    - Eliminating racial descrimination
    - Responding to natural and humanitarian disasters (e.g. Hurricane Katrina, wildfires, Ukranian War)

### Our North Star Metric: **Active Members per Month (AMPM)**
Each of the four pillars of the Knights of Columbus (Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism) is entirely dependent on the strength of the membership of us Knights. AMPM captures a council's ability to carry out the work by engaging members, deliver impactful charitable service, and sustain operations. Improving upon our AMPM will most directly result in council continuity, an increase in volunteer hours, attendance, leadership development, and a capacity for both charity and fraternity.

### KPI's
*Note, a patriotism section is not included below as that is a pillar of the Knights of Columbus that is focused in on during a Knight's time as a fourth degree Knight (most KofC members do not reach this point until after their time in university).*

**Charity KPIs**
1. Service hours per active member
2. People served per month
3. Number of service events

**Faith Formation KPIs**
1. Attendance at faith events
2. Number of formation opportunities offered
3. Member participation in sacraments/retreats

**Fundraising KPIs**
1. Net fundraising per semester
2. ROI of fundraising events
3. Fundraising events per semester

**Fraternity KPIs**
1. Fraternal events per month
2. Average attendance at fraternal events
3. New member activation rate
4. Member retention rate

**Leadership KPIs**
1. Leadership coverage (percentage of events with a designated organizer)
2. Officer participation rate
3. Number of members taking on leadership roles per semester

## BACKGROUND
Since my membership began in The Knights of Columbus Council 16207, I've noticed a series of persistent challenges that have limited our growth, member retention, and measurable community impact. These issues include:
1. Low attendance at council events
2. Largely inactive members
3. Overemphasis on meetings, excemptifications, and other administrative activities (necessary, though not mission-driving)
4. Highly motivated members pursue community impact projects individually rather than collabratively, resulting in an unfocused and inneffective council
5. Difficuly with balancing one-on-one charitable outreach -an essential part of our Catholic mission- with the need to create broad, effective, measurable impact

Many of these challenges are compounded by the realities of being a college council, unfortunately. A high turnover rate makes continuity difficult to maintain, develop long-term experience, and sustain a shared direction. Having a set of goals to achieve semester-by-semester could aleviate this issue by keeping our council focused.

As a consequence of this, it became clear to me at the beginning of the 2025-2026 Colombian year that the following were necessary to resolve these issues:
1. Systematic data tracking for membership, retention, events, funds raised, measured impact, and volunteer hours aqcuired
2. SMART goals to better orient council members
3. KPIs that align with SMART goals to have a strucutred evaluation of council performance
4. Semesterly and yearly reviews to evaluate our performance and adjust efforts accordingly
5. An accessible, easy-to-use database solution for future members to access to ensure that future members do not repeat our mistake of being unfocused.
