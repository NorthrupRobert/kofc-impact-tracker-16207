## SUMMARY
This project analyzes event, attendance, and volunteer data from Knights of Columbus Council 16207 to identify which activities generate the highest engagement and which fundraising opportunities the council should prioritize. Using this analysis, I developed a data‑driven framework for setting goals, defining KPIs, and improving continuity in a high‑turnover college organization.

### Project Demonstrations
1. Data cleaning and transformation
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. KPI development
4. Insight‑driven recommendations
5. Real‑world operational impact
6. Leadership and systems thinking

### Why it Matters
Previous Colombian years showed that our council has a high drive for volunteering, but with low measurable impact. This project shows what avenues our council should target based on other organizational volunteering efforts and our own projects. This effort also serves as a sustainable system for future members to employ themselves.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
**Council 16207 has no consistent fundraising strategy or performance metrics, limiting its ability to support charitable initiatives despite strong member engagement and volunteer hours.**

---

## STRATEGY
### What is our mission?
This can be answered with the following three questions:
1. What are we passionate about? **Serving those less fortunate**
    - Homeless ministry
    - Serving our Newman Parish community (coffee+donuts, helping with events)
2. What are we good at? ****
    - Moving
    - Planning and excecuting faith formation events
3. Why do we perservere? **To protect life at all stages**
    - Since the founding of KofC in 1882, we have served as the social safety net of society
    - Life insurance
    - Morale for soldiers during waretime
    - Ultrasound inititive
    - Education for war veterans
    - Eliminating racial descrimination
    - Responding to natural and humanitarian disasters (e.g. Hurricane Katrina, wildfires, Ukranian War)

### Council concerns about shortcomings
1. Lack of focus
    - Lots of different project underway that don't seem to connect under any one metric or banner that we can measure
    - Undefined goals
    - Individuals working solo or in small groups
2. Lack of council continuity after this year

### Our North Star Metric: **Active Members per Month (AMPM)**
Each of the four pillars of the Knights of Columbus (Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism) is entirely dependent on the strength of the membership of us Knights. AMPM captures a council's ability to carry out the work by engaging members, deliver impactful charitable service, and sustain operations. Improving upon our AMPM will most directly result in council continuity, an increase in volunteer hours, attendance, leadership development, and a capacity for both charity and fraternity.

### KPI's
*Note, a patriotism section is not included below as that is a pillar of the Knights of Columbus that is focused in on during a Knight's time as a fourth degree Knight (most KofC members do not reach this point until after their time in university).*

**Charity KPIs**
1. Service hours per active member
2. People served per month
3. Number of service events

**Faith Formation KPIs**
1. Attendance at faith events
2. Number of formation opportunities offered

**Fundraising KPIs**
1. Net fundraising per semester
2. ROI of fundraising events
3. Fundraising events per semester

**Fraternity KPIs**
1. Fraternal events per month
2. Average attendance at fraternal events

**Leadership KPIs**
1. Leadership coverage (percentage of events with a designated organizer)
2. Officer participation rate
3. Number of members taking on leadership roles per semester

**AMPM**
3. New member activation rate
4. Member retention rate

## BACKGROUND
Since my membership began in The Knights of Columbus Council 16207, I've noticed a series of persistent challenges that have limited our growth, member retention, and measurable community impact. These issues include:
1. Low attendance at council events
2. Largely inactive members
3. Overemphasis on meetings, excemptifications, and other administrative activities (necessary, though not mission-driving)
4. Highly motivated members pursue community impact projects individually rather than collabratively, resulting in an unfocused and inneffective council
5. Difficuly with balancing one-on-one charitable outreach -an essential part of our Catholic mission- with the need to create broad, effective, measurable impact

Many of these challenges are compounded by the realities of being a college council, unfortunately. A high turnover rate makes continuity difficult to maintain, develop long-term experience, and sustain a shared direction. Having a set of goals to achieve semester-by-semester could aleviate this issue by keeping our council focused.

As a consequence of this, it became clear to me at the beginning of the 2025-2026 Colombian year that the following were necessary to resolve these issues:
1. Systematic data tracking for membership, retention, events, funds raised, measured impact, and volunteer hours aqcuired
2. SMART goals to better orient council members
3. KPIs that align with SMART goals to have a strucutred evaluation of council performance
4. Semesterly and yearly reviews to evaluate our performance and adjust efforts accordingly
5. An accessible, easy-to-use database solution for future members to access to ensure that future members do not repeat our mistake of being unfocused.

More than that, one of the biggest issues was how demotivating recruiting and continuing with the council seemed to be when current members can't recall our accomplishments in the last year. Ultimately, I found (through my own experience in the gym, job-hunting, managing my finances, etc) data is empowering, encouraging, and strengthening. This is what my council needed.

## THE DATA
### Event Tracker
This project primarily relies up on a google sheets spreadsheet (that I began at the beginning of the 2025-2026 Colombian year), where I began tracking our organization's events, active members, volunteer/fraternal hours acquired, the cost and return on events, and many more metrics to guage the effectiveness of our council. This workbook was made accessible to all council 16207 members so they can follow along with our progress. Write permissions, however, were only given to council officers to ensure the integrity of the data.

This workbook is meant to act as the template for future members to utilize and evaluate their success as a council in a given Colombian year. To this end, Google sheets was utilized due to the following reasons:
1. minimal technical skills required
2. portable solution
3. a familiar ecosystem for students
These factors are all incredibly important, as to ensure the continuity of our council despite our high turnover rate. In short, utilizing google sheets helps minimize barrier-to-entry for future members.

## METHODOLOGY
### Tracking Data
Google forms for data-entry

### Member-Level Analysis
A core design principle of this oeprating system is to minimize friction for future officers. To keep data-entry as simple as possible for future members that utilize this operating system, a big effort was made to ensure that the majority of features were kept within the boundaries of the Google sheets ecosystem, as not to increase the barrier-to-entry on any of these technology adaptations. After all, adopting a new process or technology is never worthwhile should task effort ever outweigh operational efficiency.

Because the Participating_Members field is stored as a comma‑separated list within a single cell on the Events sheet, transforming this data into a normalized, member‑level structure proved cumbersome and brittle when attempted purely with spreadsheet formulas. To preserve the simplicity of data entry for future officers while still enabling deeper analytics, a lightweight Google Apps Script was introduced.

This script automatically parses each event’s participant list and generates a clean, row‑by‑row member‑level table in the Analysis (Auto) sheet. A trigger runs this process whenever the spreadsheet is updated, ensuring the analytics layer stays continuously in sync with the underlying event data. With this normalized structure in place, the system can reliably compute KPIs tied to our North Star metric—such as AMPM, retention, member activation, participation distribution, event impact, cohort analysis, and officer workload—without increasing the operational burden on council members.

### Analysis

### Dashboards
#### AMPM
Graphs: 
1. bar graph of active members per month over last year or so, and have an 'average' line to guage performance at a glance (or should this be a moving average? what kind of average?)
3. members activated per month (when we see a new member show up to an event)
4. distribution of how new members were activated based on event type
5. % of Members active in the last 90 days
6. Histogram of members who attended 1 event, 2 events . . .
7. pivot table of all currently inactive members who are NOT alumni (they can still be reactivated), organized by furtherest departure date to closest (We call this "Reactivation Targets"? Different name thats not so aggressive?)
8. officer vs general member participation in the last 3 months

#### Retention
Initially I had thought to utilize both retention curves and cohort analysis to evaluate how different groups of new Knights respond to different programs we are a part of, how likely they are to stick with the council, etc.

While retention curves are useful for uncovering these features in large organizations, I ultimately determined that this was incredibly overkill for the project I am pursuing. With a council size of only about 30 members at any given time, this was not an appropriate solution when
1. our council has a high turnover rate
2. Members typically only come it in cohorts of 1-3 individuals
3. Most months we don't have any member activations at all
4. We have a membership size small enough where you can name every other person

Graphs:
2. distribution of active members per month (within the last 3 months, and another chart within the last 6 months, and another within the last year) of how much longer they have in the council (projected)
2. Time since last event histogram

#### Pillars
Graphs:
1. Events per pillar (charity, fraternal, faith, operations)
2. Radar chart of Recent hours accumilated for each pillar
3. Individuals serviced in the past year vs global average
4. Stacked Bar: “Member Participation Profiles”
You create categories like:

    Only Volunteer

    Only Fraternal

    Only Faith

    Only Meetings

    Volunteer + Fraternal

    Volunteer + Faith

    Fraternal + Faith

    . . .

    All 4 pillars

Then chart the counts.
